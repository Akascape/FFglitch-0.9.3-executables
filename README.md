Download links for FFglitch version 0.9.3

I am not the owner of FFglitch, this page just contains the download links for ffglitch version 0.9.3 taken from [ffglitch.org](https://ffglitch.org/).

Original download links:

For Windows:
https://ffglitch.org/pub/bin/win64/ffglitch-0.9.3-win64.7z

For Linux:
https://ffglitch.org/pub/bin/linux64/ffglitch-0.9.3-linux64.7z

For Mac:
https://ffglitch.org/pub/bin/mac64/ffglitch-0.9.3-mac64.7z

These version were not available in the [download page](https://ffglitch.org/download/) of ffglitch directly, so I created the zip file for those and uploaded them here.

All credit goes to [Ramiro Polla](https://github.com/ramiropolla) for creating FFglitch.
